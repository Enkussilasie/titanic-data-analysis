# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

## Goal
Demonstrate basic data cleaning, summary statistics, and visualization using a real-world dataset.

## Tools Used
- **R** (tidyverse, ggplot2) / **Python** (pandas, matplotlib)
- **Dataset**: [Titanic Passenger Data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

## Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values.
2. **Summary Statistics**: Calculated mean, median, etc.
3. **Visualization**: Created histograms for age distribution.

## How to Run
1. Download the `data.csv` file.
2. Run `analysis.R` (or `analysis.py`).
3. Outputs: 
   - Summary stats in console.
   - Plot saved as `age_distribution.png`.
   - 4. **Extra Analysis**: Compared survival rates by gender.  
   - Output: ![Survival by Gender](survival_by_gender.png)
   - ## Key Findings  
- 74% of female passengers survived vs. 19% of males.  
- Average age: 29.7 years.
